We'll review the different ways I know to handle path and current directory in javascript
For each example below we'll assume this folder structure :

```
app
├── main.js
└──lib
   └── script.js
```


### process.cwd()

- returns the directory from which the `node` command has been invoked. It is a global property.

With our structure above, let say we have this code :




```javascript
// main.js
// todo check if slash are in right order
import script from './lib/script.js'

console.log(process.cwd()) // => C:\app
console.log(__dirname) // => C:\app
console.log(__dirname===process.cwd()) // => true
```

```javascript
// script.js
console.log(process.cwd()) // => C:\app
console.log(__dirname) // => C:\app\lib
console.log(__dirname===process.cwd()) // => false
```




### __dirname

- returns the directory of current executed source code. It is a module property

### path.join

- path.join returns a normalized path by merging two paths together. It can return an absolute path, but it doesn't necessarily always do so

If no argument is provided, it returns the absolute path to the current directory aka __dirname

### When are they equivalent :

### What they have in common :

- they both take care of normalizing the path if there are too many `/`

```
console.log(path.join('//ssl')); => "/ssl"
console.log(path.resolve('//ssl')); => "/ssl"
```

### When should you use one or the other :

### What if you don't provide arguments :

```
console.log(path.join()); // => .
console.log(path.resolve()); // => __dirname
```
