description: There are different ways to play with path in JS, wanted to make a recap / reminder for myself as I was tired of googling it every time

We'll review the different ways I know to handle path and current directory in javascript
For each example below we'll assume this folder structure :

```
app
├── main.js
└── lib
   └── script.js
```

<AnchorTitle id="process_and_dirname"> process.cwd() and __dirname </AnchorTitle>

- **process.cwd()**: returns the absolute path to the directory from which <em>the `node` command has been invoked</em>. It is a global property.
- **__dirname** : returns the absolute path to the directory <em>containing the source file</em> that is being executed.


With our structure above, let's assume we have the following code :

```javascript
// main.js
const script = require ('./lib/script.js')
```

```javascript
// script.js
console.log( process.cwd())
console.log(__dirname)
console.log(__dirname===process.cwd())
```

We invoke it from `main.js`

```bash
cd app && node main.js
```

Output:
```javascript
/Users/matt/personal/test-cwd-dirname/app
/Users/matt/personal/test-cwd-dirname/app/lib
false
```

Now let's say we invoke it directly from the `script.js`

```bash
cd app && node lib/script.js
```

Output:
```javascript
/Users/matt/personal/test-cwd-dirname/app/lib
/Users/matt/personal/test-cwd-dirname/app/lib
true
```


<AnchorTitle id="path_join_and_path_resolve"> path.join and path.resolve </AnchorTitle>

- **path.join** returns a normalized path by merging two paths together. It can return an absolute path, but it doesn't necessarily always do so
- **path.resolve** turns a sequence of paths or path segments into an absolute path. Consuming path from right to left and stopping at the first absolute path found

### What they have in common :

- they both return a path
- they both take care of normalizing the path.  (resolving the ../ for example or dedupping the /)

### When are they equivalent :



- When you pass them an absolute path as the only argument

```
console.log(path.join('/ssl')); => "/ssl"
console.log(path.resolve('/ssl')); => "/ssl"
```

- When you pass them an absolute path followed by some non-absolute extra path segment :

```
console.log(path.join(__dirname, some, dir)) === console.log(path.resolve(__dirname, some, dir))
```

### What if you don't provide arguments :

Let's assume we use the same folder structure as above with the following `script.js` file

```
app
├── main.js
└── lib
   └── script.js
```

```javascript
// script.js
console.log(path.join());
console.log(path.resolve());
```

We invoke it from `main.js`

```bash
cd app && node main.js
```

Output:
```javascript
.
/Users/matt/personal/test-cwd-dirname/app
```

Now let's say we invoke it directly from the `script.js`

```bash
cd app && node lib/script.js
```

Output:
```javascript
/Users/matt/personal/test-cwd-dirname/app/lib
/Users/matt/personal/test-cwd-dirname/app/lib
true
```



```

```

### When no root argument :



### Use with __dirname
