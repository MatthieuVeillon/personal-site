I switched career at 33 through a bootcamp. A lot of us do it at various ages, some younger, some later on. I globally really enjoyed the ride and learning experience.

During the bootcamp we were exposed to the concept of [growth vs fixed mindset](https://fs.blog/2015/03/carol-dweck-mindset/), at this stage the concept seemed to click - it was feeling comfortable, I was confident in my ability to learn and proud of my capacity to pivot.
